# Bug-Bounty-Web-Security-Research-Report-

This repository contains my work for a university bug bounty assignment & my personal bugbounty experience, where I assessed ten different real-world websites (via platforms like Bugcrowd, Intigriti, and HackerOne) for security vulnerabilities. The reports follow standard bug bounty disclosure formats and are intended for educational purposes.

## 🌟 Project Summary

- **Objective:** Identify and report vulnerabilities on real-world websites to demonstrate web security testing skills.
- **Scope:** 10 websites, 10 unique reports, covering various OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.
- **Outcome:** most of reports are went on a way as security assesment, One vulnerability responsibly disclosed to a company.
- **Tools & Platforms:** Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, browser developer tools, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, HackerOne,etc...
